Q:
Create a new deployment named red with the nginx image and 2 replicas, and ensure it gets placed on the controlplane node only.

Use the label key - node-role.kubernetes.io/control-plane - which is already set on the controlplane node.


Name: red
Replicas: 2
Image: nginx
NodeAffinity: requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution
Key: node-role.kubernetes.io/control-plane
Use the right operator

A:
```
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: red
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      run: nginx
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        run: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - image: nginx
        imagePullPolicy: Always
        name: nginx
      affinity:
        nodeAffinity:
          requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
            nodeSelectorTerms:
            - matchExpressions:
              - key: node-role.kubernetes.io/control-plane
                operator: Exists
```

I was cooked by affinity syntax, love affinity. Make sure correct the syntax errors.
